    "question_text": "An ML engineer has deployed an Amazon SageMaker model to a serverless endpoint in production. The model is invoked by the InvokeEndpoint API operation.\n\nThe model's latency in production is higher than the baseline latency in the test environment. The ML engineer thinks that the increase in latency is because of model startup time.\n\nWhat should the ML engineer do to confirm or deny this hypothesis?",
